2026-01-07: Completed 'Most Recent Teaching' component feature. Enhanced the styling with a gradient overlay (from-black/40 to-black/60) and improved drop shadows for better text readability on both light and dark background images. The component displays the most recent teaching with cover photo, title, and description. All PRD requirements met. Ready for type checking and linting validation.

2026-01-07: Fixed TypeScript errors in most-recent-teaching.tsx by adding undefined check for getMostRecentTeaching() return value. Fixed linting issues in configuration files (tsconfig.json and .claude/settings.local.json) using biome formatter. All type checks and linting now pass successfully. Verified MCP server endpoint is responding correctly. Feature is fully complete and ready for commit. PRD has been updated with passes: true.
